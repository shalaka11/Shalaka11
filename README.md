# SHAPEAI WEB DEV BOOTCAMP 
Hi I made this project during the 7 Days Free Bootcamp, conducted by <b> SHAPEAI </b>. 
The instructor during the session was Mr. Shaurya Sinha (Data Analyst Intern at Jio). 
I got to learn a lot during these 7 days and it was an amazing experience learning with SHAPEAI.

<br>I got to have hands on experience on: <li>HTML <li>CSS <br>during these 7 days, and everything was explained from the very basics so that anyone with zero experience on programming can learn. 
I enjoyed these 7 days, you can as well.
